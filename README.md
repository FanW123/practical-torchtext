# Practical Torchtext
A set of tutorials for using torchtext effectively.
Current tutorials:
- Text classification
- Word-level language modeling

Tutorials scheduled to come:
- Character-level language modeling
- Machine Translation

# Purpose
The documentation of torchtext is still relatively incomplete, and using torchtext effectively currently requires reading through a fairly large amount of code. This set of tutorials aims to provide working examples of uses of torchtext to enable more users to make full use of this fanstastic library.
