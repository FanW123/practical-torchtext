# torchtext_tutorials
A set of tutorials for torchtext.

# Purpose
The documentation of torchtext is still relatively incomplete, and using torchtext effectively currently requires reading through a fairly large amount of code. This set of tutorials aims to provide working examples of uses of torchtext to enable more users to make full use of this fanstastic library.
